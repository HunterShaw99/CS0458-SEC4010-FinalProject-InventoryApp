		 * Main loop of program should check always before anything if there is a data file. This data file is where the products
		 * within the collections will be stored. If the program checks and there is no data file create a new one, if there is a data file 
		 * and it contains data load the collections with the data. Again, this will be done before any interactions with the actual user. 
		 * 
		 * Once we get or create the data file we will ask to input data if the data file was just created as there is no data. However, if the data
		 * file does exist then we will display a current list of the products. There will be commands to navigate the list of products. 
		 * 
		 * COMMANDS: How the user will interact with the data inside of the collections. 
		 *  - ADD
		 *  - REMOVE
		 *  - SEARCH
		 *  
		 * The ADD command will be how the user can add an element(product) to the collections and when an ADD is successful, display the updated list. 
		 * 
		 * The REMOVE command is used to remove a specific element(product) from the collections and if successful, the newly updated list is automatically displayed. 
		 * 
		 * The SEARCH command will used to search for a unique product in the list, if the search is successful display that single product to the user. Prompt them 
		 * to go back to the list and wait for a response.
