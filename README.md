The overall concept for the app, create an easy way to manage basic office supplies. However, there have been many changes
to how the project does this. Originally the code was more procedural but now is more OO(Object-Oriented). Additionally,
the original app used a dictionary whereas now map is used. There are a lot of additions to come for the app/project as 
features are still being worked on or new ideas come to mind for the project.
