# Weierman-Final
Final project for Data Structures and Files
The final project has to implement two data structures that were discussed in class. These must be our (the students) own implementation. If the standard API implementation is used it is an automatic zero.   
Additionally, it should incorporate some persistence mechanism. A connection to a database or file i/o would be best. 
Optional, but strongly recommended is Junit or Scala for unit testing.
